## 🌱 Withdrawals FAQ

### Withdrawals: How can I withdraw $FLOWER?
Go to the Retreat (Map icon), walk up to the goblin with a wallet icon, click the $FLOWER icon, and choose **Ronin** or **Base Network**. Withdrawals must be initiated in‑game and directed to a supported blockchain.

---

### Withdrawals: Do I need ETH to withdraw?
Yes. ETH is required to cover gas fees. Buy ETH on the **Base Network** (via Binance, Coinbase, or your wallet provider). Only ETH on Base is accepted.

---

### Withdrawals: How to fix "shared network error"?
You must wait **14 days** from when the error first appeared. This is part of the system’s security process.

---

### Withdrawals: When was the "shared network error" implemented?
On **January 12, 2026**. It prevents abuse of withdrawals and ensures fair play.

---

### Withdrawals: Why do I get a "shared network error" if my network isn’t shared?
Most ISPs use **dynamic IPs**. If another player used the same IP recently, the system applies the 14‑day wait.

---

### Withdrawals: Do I need to change my IP?
No. Just wait the full **two‑week period**. Changing your IP won’t bypass the rule.

---

## 💰 Deposits FAQ

### Deposits: How can I deposit $FLOWER in‑game?
Click the **Gem icon**, select **Deposit $FLOWER**, and choose your linked wallet or enter another address.

---

### Deposits: What tokens can I deposit?
Only **$FLOWER**. Other tokens are not recognized.

---

### Deposits: I accidentally sent ETH (or another token). Can it be returned?
No. The deposit contract only recognizes $FLOWER. Other tokens cannot be recovered.

---

### Deposits: Why is only $FLOWER accepted?
The contract is designed specifically for $FLOWER to protect the game economy.

---

### Deposits: My deposit isn’t showing
Open the **Gem icon**, select **Deposit $FLOWER**, confirm the correct network, and hit **Refresh**.

## 🌐 Network Transactions FAQ

### Transactions: I have enough gas fee but cannot proceed
Possible causes:  
- Network congestion  
- Gas limit too low  
- Nonce conflicts  
- Smart contract errors  
- Wallet/RPC issues

---

### Transactions: Why does my transaction stay pending?
Usually due to **network congestion**. If your gas price is too low, it may remain pending. Use “speed up” in your wallet.

---

### Transactions: What should I do if my transaction is stuck?
1. Check pending transactions.  
2. Use “cancel” or “speed up.”  
3. Increase gas price.  
4. Switch to a reliable RPC endpoint.  
5. Wait until congestion eases and retry.
