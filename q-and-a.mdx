## Did I register my SunflowerLand account using MetaMask or Ronin?
Your wallet address isn’t tied to MetaMask, Ronin, or any other wallet app. Think of it like a house key—you can put the same key on different keychains, but it will always open the same door. In crypto, that ‘key’ is your recovery phrase.  

We cannot confirm which app you used because wallet addresses come directly from the blockchain, not from the app brand. The app is only the tool you used to access your wallet, so the blockchain does not record whether you used MetaMask, Ronin, or another wallet.

## How to fix "shared network error" on withdrawal?
If you see a share network error, you need to wait **14 days** from when the error first appeared.  
This waiting time is required by the system’s security process, so retrying earlier will not work.

---

## My face verification is linked to an old farm ID. How do I move it to my new account?
If you’ve been playing on your new account for at least 30 days, you can ask the support team to remove the face verification from your old farm. Once they reset it, you’ll be able to complete face verification on your new account.  
This step is necessary because face verification is tied to the farm ID you first used.

---

## Do I need to change my network/IP before waiting two weeks for a withdrawal?
No, you don’t need to change your IP address or network settings. The important step is to wait the full **two‑week period** before trying another withdrawal.  
This waiting time is part of the system’s security checks, so changing your network won’t speed it up.

---

## Can my relative use my old phone to play SunflowerLand?
Yes, your relative can use your old phone to create and play on their own account. Once they start using the device, make sure only their account is logged in and you don’t log in again.  
This rule exists to prevent multiple accounts from being linked to the same device, which could trigger bans for suspicious activity.

---

## What does ‘1 person = 1 account’ mean?
It means each person is allowed only one account in SunflowerLand. Playing with multiple accounts is not permitted and can lead to a ban.  
This rule exists to keep the game fair and prevent abuse from players using multiple accounts.

---

## I claimed the ‘More Picks’ skill, but my tool stock hasn’t changed. Is this a bug?
No, this isn’t a bug. The ‘More Picks’ skill affects gem restocks, not the daily free restocks.  
This distinction exists because the skill is designed to improve gem‑based restocking options, not the free daily ones.

---

## I no longer have access to my wallet address. How can I recover my SunflowerLand account?
If you’ve lost access to your wallet’s seed phrase, you won’t be able to recover your SunflowerLand account. Accounts are permanently tied to the wallet you used at registration, and only the seed phrase can unlock it.  
This rule exists because blockchain wallets are self‑custodied — no provider or game team can restore access without the original recovery phrase.

---

## I don’t have ETH and can’t complete my withdrawal. Can you remove the pending transaction?
No, pending withdrawal transactions cannot be removed from your game account. You must complete the withdrawal on your end using ETH to cover the transaction.  
This rule exists because blockchain transactions are immutable once created — they can’t be canceled or deleted by the game team.

---

## Can you unbind or unlink a Discord account from my SunflowerLand account?
No, we cannot unbind or unlink any social media accounts (including Discord) that are linked to your SunflowerLand account.  
This policy exists because the removal feature was paused after players abused it to create multiple accounts, which violates the one‑account‑per‑person rule.

---

## My SunflowerLand account got banned. Can you tell me why?
We understand it’s frustrating to have your account banned, but bans are never issued without a clear reason. Due to security, we cannot share the exact details of our investigation process. If you believe the ban was a mistake, you can request a review by providing evidence when asked.  
This policy exists to protect the integrity of the game and prevent players from exploiting knowledge of our investigation methods.

---

## I don’t have ETH and don’t know how to get it. How can I withdraw my flowers?
To withdraw, you’ll need ETH to cover the transaction fees. You can purchase ETH through exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, or directly from the wallet provider you’re using. Make sure to buy and transfer ETH on the **Base Network** so it works correctly with SunflowerLand withdrawals.  
This requirement exists because blockchain withdrawals need ETH for gas fees, and only ETH on the Base Network is accepted.

---

## Can I sell items to my friends for cheaper than the marketplace price?
No, selling items to friends for cheaper than the marketplace price is considered a bannable offense. Players have previously been banned for engaging in this behavior, as it is treated as multi‑accounting and funneling activity.  
This rule exists to keep the economy fair and prevent players from bypassing the marketplace system, which could give some accounts an unfair advantage.

---

## What is funneling activity?
Funneling activity happens when one account gives items, resources, or advantages to another account in a way that bypasses the marketplace or game rules.  
This is considered multi‑accounting and can lead to a ban because it creates unfair advantages and disrupts the game’s economy.

## How can I withdraw $FLOWER?
You can withdraw $FLOWER by going to the Retreat (click the Map icon) and walking up to the goblin with a wallet icon. Click the $FLOWER icon and choose the network you’d like to receive your tokens on — either **Ronin** or **Base Network**.  
This process exists because withdrawals must be initiated in‑game and directed to a supported blockchain network to ensure secure transfers.

## When was the "shared network error" implemented?
The shared network error was implemented on **January 12, 2026**.  
This security measure was added to prevent abuse of withdrawals and ensure fair play. If you encounter this error, you’ll need to wait the required **14‑day period** before trying again.

## Why do I get a "shared network error" if my network isn’t shared?
Even if your network isn’t shared, most Internet service providers use **dynamic IP addresses**. This means your IP address can change over time and may be temporarily assigned to another user.  
If another player using the same IP has already made a withdrawal, the system will detect it as a shared network and apply the **14‑day waiting period**.  
This rule exists to prevent multiple withdrawals from the same IP in a short time, ensuring fairness and security.

## I accidentally sent ETH (or another token) to my deposit address. Can it be returned?
No, tokens sent to the deposit address cannot be returned. The deposit address is a **contract address** that only recognizes and processes **$FLOWER**.  
If you send ETH or any other token to this address, the system cannot recover or refund it because the contract is not designed to handle anything except $FLOWER.  
This rule exists to protect the integrity of the game economy and ensure deposits are processed securely.
