## Ongoing Issues FAQ
*(Temporary issues currently under investigation. Entries will be removed once resolved.)*

## Withdrawals FAQ

### Why am I unable to withdraw tokens from my wallet?
Withdrawals fail when the wallet used does not match the wallet linked to the Land ID. Tokens can only be withdrawn to the wallet associated with the account. Attempting to withdraw with a different wallet will not trigger a transaction.

**Also asked as:**
- Why is my withdrawal not processing?
- How do I withdraw tokens to my linked wallet?
- What happens if I try to withdraw with the wrong wallet?
- Why does my withdrawal transaction not show up?

---

### What is the cooldown period after trading an account?  
After an account is traded, the new owner can continue playing the game but cannot sell items or withdraw assets for 90 days. This cooldown period is designed to prevent multi-account exploitation and ensure fair marketplace activity.  

**Irreversible:** The 90-day cooldown is automatically enforced and cannot be bypassed or shortened once an account has been traded.  

**Also asked as:**  
- How long do I need to wait before selling after trading an account?  
- What restrictions apply to newly traded accounts?  
- Why can’t I withdraw after buying an account?  
- Is there a cooldown when transferring account ownership?

---

### Why is my withdrawal taking so long? (14‑day restriction)
Withdrawals may take longer due to security checks triggered by shared IP addresses. Even if you only play on one device, your ISP may assign you an IP previously used by another player. In this case, the system enforces a 14‑day waiting period to protect your funds. This is not a penalty, but a precaution. Once the period ends, your withdrawal will process normally.  

**Also asked as:**
- Why do I have to wait 14 days to withdraw?
- Why is my withdrawal delayed due to security?
- Why can’t I withdraw right now?

---

### How can I withdraw $FLOWER?
Go to the Retreat (Map icon), walk up to the goblin with a wallet icon, click the $FLOWER icon, and choose **Ronin** or **Base Network**.

**Also asked as:**
- How do I cash out FLOWER?
- How do I transfer FLOWER to my wallet?
- How do I move FLOWER off the game?
- How do I withdraw FLOWER to Ronin/Base?

---

### Do I need ETH to withdraw?  
ETH is required to cover gas fees. Buy ETH on the **Base Network**, as only ETH on Base is accepted.  

**Irreversible:** Withdrawals cannot be completed without ETH on the Base Network; no alternative method exists.  

**Also asked as:**  
- Why do I need ETH for withdrawals  
- Do I need gas fees to withdraw FLOWER  
- Can I use ETH from another network  
- Is ETH required for FLOWER withdrawal

---

### Why do I get a "shared network error" if my network isn’t shared?

- Why do I get shared network error on my own IP?
- Why does shared network error happen if I’m not sharing?
- How does dynamic IP cause shared network error?

---

### Why do I see a shared network error when withdrawing?

**Also asked as:**
- Why can’t I withdraw because of shared network
- What does shared network error mean
- How do I fix shared Wi‑Fi withdrawal error

- Should I reset my router to fix shared network error?
- Do I need a new IP to withdraw FLOWER?

## Deposits FAQ

### Why does my wallet transaction fail when I try to deposit from another wallet?
Deposits from a wallet that is not linked to the Land ID require selecting the “deposit from other wallet” option. Without this selection, the transaction will not appear, as the system only recognizes the linked wallet by default.

## Network Transactions FAQ

### Why is my withdrawal transaction taking so long? (network confirmation)
Once your withdrawal is initiated, it must be confirmed on the blockchain. This can take longer if the network is congested, if gas fees are set too low, or if there are wallet/RPC issues. If your transaction is stuck, you can try to speed it up by increasing the gas price or switching to a reliable RPC endpoint.  

**Also asked as:**
- Why is my withdrawal transaction pending?
- Why is my FLOWER transfer stuck on the blockchain?

---

### I have enough gas fee but cannot proceed
Possible causes:

- Wallet/RPC issues

---

### What should I do if my transaction is stuck?
1. Check pending transactions.  
2. Use “cancel” or “speed up.”  
3. Increase gas price.  
4. Switch to a reliable RPC endpoint.  
5. Wait until congestion eases and retry.

---

### Why does my transaction stay pending?
A transaction remains pending when the gas price is too low or the network is congested. Use the “speed up” option in your wallet to increase gas price and confirm faster.

**Also asked as:**
- Why is my crypto transaction stuck pending
- Why won’t my transfer confirm
- Pending blockchain transaction not processing
- How do I fix a pending transaction

---

### Which networks and gas tokens does the game use?  
The game operates across three networks, each requiring its own gas token. Ronin uses RON for gas, Base uses ETH for gas, and Polygon uses POL for gas. Each network supports specific use cases: Ronin and Base handle $FLOWER deposits and withdrawals, while Polygon is used for store transactions on chain and Sunflower Land NFT transfers.  

**Irreversible:** Transactions cannot be completed without the correct gas token for the chosen network; no alternative method exists.  

**Also asked as:**
