## Network Transactions FAQ

### I have enough gas fee but cannot proceed
Possible causes:  
- Network congestion  
- Gas limit too low  
- Nonce conflicts  
- Smart contract errors  
- Wallet/RPC issues

---

### Why does my transaction stay pending?
Usually due to **network congestion**. If your gas price is too low, it may remain pending. Use “speed up” in your wallet.

---

### What should I do if my transaction is stuck?
1. Check pending transactions.  
2. Use “cancel” or “speed up.”  
3. Increase gas price.  
4. Switch to a reliable RPC endpoint.  
5. Wait until congestion eases and retry.
