## Did I register my SunflowerLand account using MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet?
Your wallet address isn’t locked to MetaMask, Coinbase, Ronin, or any other wallet app. Think of it like a house key—you can put the same key on different keychains, but it will always open the same door. 

In crypto, that ‘key’ is your **recovery phrase**. No matter which wallet app you use, if you enter the same recovery phrase, you’ll unlock the same wallet address. We cannot confirm which app you used because the wallet address comes from the blockchain, not the app brand. The app is just the tool you used to access it.

## Do I need to change my network/IP before waiting two weeks for a withdrawal?
No, you do not necessarily need to change your IP address or network settings. The most important factor is the timing: you must wait the full **two-week interval** before attempting another withdrawal.
