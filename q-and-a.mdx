### Which networks and gas tokens does the game use?

Each network supports specific use cases: Ronin and Base handle $FLOWER deposits and withdrawals, while Polygon is used for store transactions on chain and Sunflower Land NFT transfers.  

**Irreversible:** Transactions cannot be completed without the correct gas token for the chosen network; no alternative method exists.
