  - Mid- to late-game expansions (8–24 hours) should be started before logging off.  
  - This ensures progress continues while the player is inactive.
- **Stack progression:**  
  - Complete shorter expansions during the day, then queue longer ones at night.  
  - This balances active farming with passive progression.
- **Plan resource readiness:**  
  - Gather required coins and materials before starting an expansion.  
  - This prevents delays once timers finish.
- **Expect cumulative time:**  
  - Basic Island: ~16h total  
  - Petal Paradise: ~27h total  
  - Desert Island: ~43h total  
  - Volcano Island: ~66h total

## Cooking FAQ

### What is Cooking in Sunflower Land?

**Cooking Mechanics**

  - Kitchen: 4h 48m  
  - Smoothie Shack: 3h  
  - Deli: 2h  
  - Bakery: 2h 24m  
- Oil is expensive, so best used during competitions or for high-demand recipes.

## Strategy

### Should I eat fish raw or cook them?  
Fish can be eaten for XP, but it is almost never a good idea. Cooking recipes made from fish are always worth more XP, and many can be used for deliveries.

### What are the risks of Featherweight, Merino Whisperer, and Leathercraft Mastery?  
These skills boost output of **Feathers, Wool, or Leather**, but reduce the yield of the other animal products. Unlike some detrimental skills that can be canceled out by others, these cannot be offset.
